1. Anonymous Class:
    An anonymous class is a class without a name that is used to give implementation to:
    *) interface
    *) abstract class
    *) concreate class(method override)

interfaceName ob = new Interfacename(){
    @override
    public void method(){
        //implementation
    }
}

Lambda Expression : A Lambda expression is a short and clean way to implement a function interface (interface with only one abstract method).
--- introduced in Java 8

(parameter ) -> { body }

*  Works only with Functional interface
*  No class creation
*  Improve readability
