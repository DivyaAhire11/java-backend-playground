1. Anonymous Class:
    An anonymous class is a class without a name that is used to give implementation to:
    *) interface
    *) abstract class
    *) concreate class(method override)

interfaceName ob = new Interfacename(){
    @override
    public void method(){
        //implementation
    }
}

Lambda Expression : A Lambda expression is a short and clean way to implement a function interface (interface with only one abstract method).
--- introduced in Java 8

(parameter ) -> { body }

*  Works only with Functional interface
*  No class creation
*  Improve readability


Thread Life Cycle:
  
  NEW -> RUNNABLE -> RUNNING -> BLOCKED/WAITING  -> TERMINATE

  *) NEW : 
     --- Thread object created
     --- Not started yet

  *) RUNNABLE : 
     --- start() called
     --- waiting for CPU

   *) RUNNING :
     --- CPU executing Thread

    *) BLOCKED/WAITING :
    --- sleeping
    --- waiting for lock
    --- waiting for another Thread

    *) TERMINATE :
    --- run()  complete

Thread Class methods :
  start() : started thread
  run()   : Thread logic
  sleep(ms)  : pause thread
  join()  : wait for another thread
  yield()  : give chance to other thread
  interrupt() : interrupt sleeping thread
  getName() : Thread name
  setName() : set thread name
  setPriority() : set setPriority


  Thread Priority:
    1(MIN) --> 5(NORM) ---> 10(MAX)
